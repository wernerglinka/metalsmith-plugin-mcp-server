Metalsmith MCP Server Development Context

Project Background

This document captures the context from a comprehensive discussion about building an MCP (Model
Context Protocol) server for Metalsmith plugin development, based on proven patterns from
high-quality plugin implementations.

Catalyst Project: metalsmith-optimize-images Review

- Exceptional quality: 93.98% test coverage with 83 passing tests
- Architecture: Excellent modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Standards compliance: Professional documentation, ESLint/Prettier configs, dual ESM/CJS
  support
- Real-world complexity: Image processing, background images, progressive loading
- Assessment: Represents gold standard for Metalsmith plugin development

Philosophy & Strategic Insights

Core Philosophy: Fundamentals Over Frameworks

- Anti-framework carousel: Resist constant technology churn in favor of lasting patterns
- Sustainable web development: HTML, CSS, Node.js skills that transfer everywhere
- AI-era positioning: Understanding what tools do, not just shipping code
- Sophisticated simplicity: "Sometimes the most sophisticated choice is recognizing when you
  don't need sophistication"

Component Architecture Without Framework Overhead

- Modular building: Component-based architecture using fundamental web technologies
- Sectioned pages: Pages composed from reusable sections defined in frontmatter
- Template-driven: Clean composition using Nunjucks/Handlebars loops
- Static generation: Zero runtime overhead, compile-time modularity

Target Audience Reality

Developers using MCP servers are quality-focused early adopters who:

- Value cutting-edge tooling applied to fundamental technologies
- Want comprehensive solutions, not minimal templates
- Are building serious projects requiring maintainable patterns
- Understand that small communities allow real influence on ecosystem quality

Technical Analysis: Official vs Enhanced Standards

Comparison with Official Metalsmith core-plugin

Official Metalsmith Boilerplate:

- Basic ESLint configuration with traditional extends pattern
- Minimal testing with simple assertions
- Basic README template
- Simple release-it configuration

Enhanced Standards (Werner's Approach):

- Modern ESLint 9.x flat config with sophisticated rules
- Comprehensive testing (93.98% coverage) using real Metalsmith instances
- Production-ready documentation with badges, examples, troubleshooting
- Professional release process with GitHub integration
- Deep configuration merging and robust error handling

Strategic Decision: Use single enhanced standard only. Developers seeking MCP tools want
excellence, not compromised minimal options.

Key Architectural Patterns Identified

Plugin Structure Standards

src/
├── index.js # Main plugin entry point
├── processors/ # Core processing logic
│ ├── htmlProcessor.js # HTML parsing and manipulation
│ ├── imageProcessor.js # Core Sharp.js operations
│ └── progressiveProcessor.js # Advanced features
└── utils/ # Pure utility functions
├── config.js # Deep merge configuration
├── hash.js # Content-based hashing
└── paths.js # Filename pattern system

Testing Philosophy

- Real instances over mocks: Always use actual Metalsmith instances
- Comprehensive coverage: Target >95% with systematic gap testing
- Edge case focus: Test error conditions and unusual inputs
- Integration emphasis: Verify complete plugin workflow

Configuration Patterns

- Deep merge: Sophisticated default handling with nested object support
- Token systems: Flexible filename patterns with placeholder replacement
- Validation: Comprehensive input validation and error messages
- Documentation: Every option explained with examples

MCP Server Requirements

Core Capabilities Needed

1. Plugin Scaffolding: Generate complete plugin structure with enhanced standards
2. Configuration Generation: Create ESLint, Prettier, package.json with proven patterns
3. Test Templates: Generate comprehensive test suites following real-instance philosophy
4. Documentation Templates: Production-ready README with badges and examples
5. Standards Validation: Check existing plugins against quality standards

Tool Interface Design

// Primary scaffolding tool
await mcp.call('plugin-scaffold', {
name: 'metalsmith-feature-name',
type: 'processor', // or 'transformer', 'validator'
features: ['progressive-loading', 'background-processing', 'metadata-generation']
});

// Standards validation
await mcp.call('validate-plugin', {
path: './metalsmith-my-plugin',
checks: ['structure', 'tests', 'docs', 'package-json']
});

// Configuration generation
await mcp.call('generate-configs', {
eslint: 'modern-flat-config',
testing: 'comprehensive-coverage',
release: 'github-integration'
});

Technical Implementation Notes

- Template assets: Include all standard configurations as package resources
- Schema validation: JSON schemas for plugin configuration validation
- Pattern analysis: Tools to analyze existing plugins for compliance
- Documentation generation: Automated README and badge creation

Distribution Strategy

Target Market Reality

- Small but discerning community: Metalsmith developers value quality over quantity
- Educational mission: Teach transferable patterns that work across tools
- Influence potential: Small community allows real ecosystem impact
- Long-term thinking: Building tools that last decades, not quarters

Distribution Approach

1. NPM Package: @metalsmith/mcp-server or similar namespace
2. GitHub Integration: Direct integration with existing plugin ecosystem
3. Community Engagement: Metalsmith Discord, documentation contributions
4. Content Marketing: Blog posts demonstrating philosophy and patterns

Success Metrics

- Quality over quantity: 50-100 serious adopters building excellent plugins
- Ecosystem influence: Raise overall quality bar for all Metalsmith plugins
- Educational impact: Recognition as teaching tool for sustainable web development
- Pattern adoption: See enhanced standards adopted across community
